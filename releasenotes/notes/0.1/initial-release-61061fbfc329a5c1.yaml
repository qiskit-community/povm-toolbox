    .. note::
      Starting with this release, this project will follow
      `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.

    This is a toolbox for working with positive operator-valued measures (POVMs).
    It enables users to use POVMs for sampling the state of quantum circuits (see
    also :mod:`povm_toolbox.sampler`) and compute expectation values of any
    observable of interest (see also :mod:`povm_toolbox.post_processor`).
    The toolbox includes a library of pre-defined POVMs (see
    :mod:`povm_toolbox.library`) which provide ready-to-go POVM circuit definitions.
    You can also implement your own POVM circuits by following the provided
    interface.
    Additionally, you can work with POVMs on a quantum-informational theoretical
    footing (see :mod:`povm_toolbox.quantum_info`).
