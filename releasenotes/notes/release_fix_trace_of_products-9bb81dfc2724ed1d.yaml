    Fixing a bug in the ``ProductFrame._trace_of_prod`` method. 
    This method computes the trace of the product of two operators.
    It requires at some point the value of ``Tr[(P_N)^2]`` where ``P_N`` is an ``N``-qubit Pauli string. 
    The correct value of this trace is ``2^N`` but was previously set to ``2*N``. 
    This release fixes this issue.
    Note that this issue was only impacting ``MultiQubitFrame`` for ``num_qubit>=3`` or product of such frames.
