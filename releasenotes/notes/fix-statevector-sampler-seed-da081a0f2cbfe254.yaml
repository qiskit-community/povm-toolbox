    Fixes an issue with the `seed` of the :class:`StatevectorSampler` class that affected randomized
    projective measurements. When `seed` was an integer, the sampler would always output the same
    outcomes for each projective measurement respectively. Simply setting `seed` as a
    :class:`numpy.random.Generator` solves the issue.
