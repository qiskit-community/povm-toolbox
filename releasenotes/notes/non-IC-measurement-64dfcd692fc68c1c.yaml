    The toolbox now allows the use of non-IC measurements. This is useful, for example, if the
    observables to be estimated are known to consist solely of pauli X and Z (then no Y measurements
    are needed).

    By making this change, we now use the :func:`numpy.linalg.lstsq` method to determine
    the dual frame (i.e. the reconstruction operators) as opposed to the :func:`numpy.linalg.solve`
    method used previously, which only worked for IC measurements.
