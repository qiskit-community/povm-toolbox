    The :class:`MultiQubitFrame` objects now have a `shape` attribute. Before the shape was
    implicitly assumed to be `(len(frame.num_operators),)` and the operators were indexed by
    integers. Note that this is is still the default shape and indexing method. However, the frame
    operators can now also be indexed by multi-indices (tuple of integers) if a custom shape is
    specified.
