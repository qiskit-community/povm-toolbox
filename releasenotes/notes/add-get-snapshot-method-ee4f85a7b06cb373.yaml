    Add a method to easily access the classical "snapshots" of the state after taking some
    measurements. A classical "snapshot" of the state is the dual frame operator associated with the
    corresponding outcome. The new method returns the snapshot (typically as a product of local
    operators) associated with the queried outcome (typically a tuple of integers).
