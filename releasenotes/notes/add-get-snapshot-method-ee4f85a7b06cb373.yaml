    A new method, :meth:`.POVMPostProcessor.get_state_snapshot`, is implemented to easily access the
    classical "snapshots" of the state after taking some measurements. A classical "snapshot" of the
    state is the dual frame operator associated with the corresponding outcome. The new method
    returns the snapshot (typically as a product of local operators) associated with the queried
    outcome (typically a tuple of integers).
    In parallel, the :meth:`.ProductFrame.get_operator` method has been added for more general
    access to frame operators in a product form.
