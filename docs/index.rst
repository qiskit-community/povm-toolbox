POVM Toolbox
############

.. image:: _static/read-me-figure.jpg

This is a toolbox for working with positive operator-valued measures (POVMs).
It enables users to use POVMs for sampling the state of quantum circuits (see
also :mod:`povm_toolbox.sampler`) and compute expectation values of any
observable of interest (see also :mod:`povm_toolbox.post_processor`).
The toolbox includes a library of pre-defined POVMs (see
:mod:`povm_toolbox.library`) but also allows users to define their own POVMs
(see :mod:`povm_toolbox.quantum_info`).

In this documentation you can find a number of resources including:

- `explanations <explanations/index.html>`_ to learn more about POVMs
- how to get started with coding using one of the `tutorials <tutorials/index.html>`_
- dive into more specific features with the `how-to guides <how_tos/index.html>`_
- and, of course, look up specific details of the `API <apidocs/povm_toolbox.html>`_

Installation
------------

You can install this code via pip:

.. code-block:: bash
