POVM Toolbox
############

.. image:: _static/read-me-figure.jpg

This is a toolbox for working with positive operator-valued measures (POVMs).
It enables users to use POVMs for sampling the state of quantum circuits (see
also :mod:`povm_toolbox.sampler`) and compute expectation values of any
observable of interest (see also :mod:`povm_toolbox.post_processor`).
The toolbox includes a library of pre-defined POVMs (see
:mod:`povm_toolbox.library`) which provide ready-to-go POVM circuit definitions.
You can also implement your own POVM circuits by following the provided
interface.
Additionally, you can work with POVMs on a quantum-informational theoretical
footing (see :mod:`povm_toolbox.quantum_info`).

In this documentation you can find a number of resources including:

- `explanations <explanations/index.html>`_ to learn more about POVMs
- how to get started with coding using one of the `tutorials <tutorials/index.html>`_
- dive into more specific features with the `how-to guides <how_tos/index.html>`_
- and, of course, look up specific details of the `API <apidocs/povm_toolbox.html>`_

Deprecation Policy
------------------

We follow `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ and are guided by the principles in
`Qiskit's deprecation policy <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/DEPRECATION.md>`_.
We may occasionally make breaking changes in order to improve the user experience.
When possible, we will keep old interfaces and mark them as deprecated, as long as they can co-exist with the
new ones.
Each substantial improvement, breaking change, or deprecation will be documented in the
`release notes <https://qiskit-community.github.io/povm-toolbox/release-notes.html>`_.
