# POVMs

![overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiskit-community/povm-toolbox/main/docs/_static/read-me-figure.jpg)

This is a toolbox for working with positive operator-valued measures (POVMs).
It enables users to use POVMs for sampling the state of quantum circuits (see
also `povm_toolbox.sampler`) and compute expectation values of any observable of
interest (see also `povm_toolbox.post_processor`).
The toolbox includes a library of pre-defined POVMs (see `povm_toolbox.library`)
which provide ready-to-go POVM circuit definitions. You can also implement your
own POVM circuits by following the provided interface.
Additionally, you can work with POVMs on a quantum-informational theoretical
footing (see `povm_toolbox.quantum_info`).

## Installation

want to install this code, before running the below.

You can install this code via pip:
```
pip install povm-toolbox
```

Alternatively, you can install it from source:
