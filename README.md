This is a toolbox for working with positive operator-valued measures (POVMs).
It enables users to use POVMs for sampling the state of quantum circuits (see
also `povm_toolbox.sampler`) and compute expectation values of any observable of
interest (see also `povm_toolbox.post_processor`).
The toolbox includes a library of pre-defined POVMs (see `povm_toolbox.library`)
but also allows users to define their own POVMs (see `povm_toolbox.quantum_info`).

## Installation

You can install this code via pip:

cd povm-toolbox
pip install .
```

Make sure that you have the correct Python environment active, into which you
want to install this code, before running the above.

If you intend to develop on this code, you should consider reading the
