    This post-processor implementation provides a straight-forward interface for computing the
    expectation values (and standard deviations) of any Pauli-based observable. It is initialized
    with a :class:`.POVMPubResult` as shown below:

    >>> from povm_toolbox.library import ClassicalShadows

    >>> from povm_toolbox.post_processor import POVMPostProcessor
    >>> from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

    >>> from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp

    >>> _ = circ.h(0)
    >>> _ = circ.cx(0, 1)
    >>> povm = ClassicalShadows(2, seed=42)
    >>> sampler = StatevectorSampler(seed=42)
    >>> povm_sampler = POVMSampler(sampler)
    >>> job = povm_sampler.run([circ], povm=povm, shots=16)

    Additionally, this post-processor also supports the customization of the Dual frame in which the
    decomposition weights of the provided observable are obtained. Check out
    `this how-to guide <../how_tos/dual_optimizer.ipynb>`_ for more details on how to do this.
